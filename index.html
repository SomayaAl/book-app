        A <strong> fictional book </strong> is a text created specifically for a
        work in an imaginary narrative that is referred to, depicted, or
        excerpted in a story, book, film, or other fictional work, and which
        exists only in one or more fictional works. A fictional book may be
        created to add realism or depth to a larger fictional work.
